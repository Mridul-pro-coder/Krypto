Ethereum Transaction DApp
A decentralized application (DApp) built using React and Ethers.js that facilitates sending Ethereum transactions and viewing transaction history directly on the blockchain. This project demonstrates basic Web3 integration, allowing users to connect their MetaMask wallet, send ETH with messages and keywords, and see a list of past transactions.

Features
Wallet Connection: Connects seamlessly with MetaMask to manage user accounts.

Send Transactions: Allows users to send Ethereum (ETH) to another address with an optional message and keyword.

Transaction History: Displays a list of recent transactions, including sender, receiver, amount, message, keyword, and timestamp.

Loading Indicators: Provides visual feedback during transaction processing.

Responsive Design: (Presumed, if implemented) Adapts to various screen sizes for a smooth user experience.

Technologies Used
React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

Ethers.js: A complete, simple, and powerful JavaScript library for interacting with the Ethereum Blockchain and its ecosystem.

Solidity: The programming language used for writing the smart contract.

MetaMask: A popular browser extension wallet for interacting with Ethereum.

Tailwind CSS: (If used for styling) A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.

Getting Started
Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

Prerequisites
Node.js (LTS version recommended)

npm (comes with Node.js) or Yarn

MetaMask browser extension installed and configured with an Ethereum account (and some test ETH if you're testing on a testnet).

Installation
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name

(Remember to replace YourUsername/your-repo-name with your actual GitHub username and repository name.)

Install dependencies:

npm install
# or
yarn install

Running the Application
Start the development server:

npm start
# or
yarn start

This will open the application in your browser at http://localhost:3000 (or another port if 3000 is in use).

Smart Contract
This DApp interacts with a custom Solidity smart contract responsible for handling transaction data on the Ethereum blockchain.

Contract Address
The contract address for the (Testnet/Mainnet - specify which!) network is defined in src/utils/constants.js:

const contractAddress = "YOUR_DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS";

Important: If you want to use this DApp on a different network (e.g., Ethereum Mainnet), you must deploy your smart contract to that network and update contractAddress accordingly.
