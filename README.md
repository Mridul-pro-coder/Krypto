Ethereum Transaction DAppA decentralized application (DApp) built using React and Ethers.js that facilitates sending Ethereum transactions and viewing transaction history directly on the blockchain. This project demonstrates basic Web3 integration, allowing users to connect their MetaMask wallet, send ETH with messages and keywords, and see a list of past transactions.Table of ContentsFeaturesTechnologies UsedGetting StartedPrerequisitesInstallationRunning the ApplicationSmart ContractContract AddressABIDeployment (for Developers)UsageContributingLicenseFeaturesWallet Connection: Connects seamlessly with MetaMask to manage user accounts.Send Transactions: Allows users to send Ethereum (ETH) to another address with an optional message and keyword.Transaction History: Displays a list of recent transactions, including sender, receiver, amount, message, keyword, and timestamp.Loading Indicators: Provides visual feedback during transaction processing.Responsive Design: (Presumed, if implemented) Adapts to various screen sizes for a smooth user experience.Technologies UsedReact: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.Ethers.js: A complete, simple, and powerful JavaScript library for interacting with the Ethereum Blockchain and its ecosystem.Solidity: The programming language used for writing the smart contract.MetaMask: A popular browser extension wallet for interacting with Ethereum.Tailwind CSS: (If used for styling) A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.Getting StartedFollow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.PrerequisitesNode.js (LTS version recommended)npm (comes with Node.js) or YarnMetaMask browser extension installed and configured with an Ethereum account (and some test ETH if you're testing on a testnet).InstallationClone the repository:git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
(Remember to replace YourUsername/your-repo-name with your actual GitHub username and repository name.)Install dependencies:npm install
# or
yarn install
Running the ApplicationStart the development server:npm start
# or
yarn start
This will open the application in your browser at http://localhost:3000 (or another port if 3000 is in use).Smart ContractThis DApp interacts with a custom Solidity smart contract responsible for handling transaction data on the Ethereum blockchain.Contract AddressThe contract address for the (Testnet/Mainnet - specify which!) network is defined in src/utils/constants.js:const contractAddress = "YOUR_DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS";Important: If you want to use this DApp on a different network (e.g., Ethereum Mainnet), you must deploy your smart contract to that network and update contractAddress accordingly.ABIThe Application Binary Interface (ABI) of the smart contract is located at src/utils/constants.js as contractABI. This ABI tells the frontend how to interact with the functions and variables of your deployed contract.Deployment (for Developers)To deploy the smart contract yourself, you would typically use tools like Hardhat or Truffle. Here's a conceptual outline:Set up your development environment:Install Hardhat/Truffle.Configure hardhat.config.js or truffle-config.js with network details (e.g., Sepolia testnet RPC URL and your private key for deployment).Compile the contract:npx hardhat compile
# or
truffle compile
Deploy the contract:npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network sepolia
# or
truffle migrate --network sepolia
(Replace sepolia with your desired network.)Update src/utils/constants.js: After successful deployment, update contractAddress with the new address of your deployed contract.UsageConnect Wallet: Click the "Connect Wallet" button to connect your MetaMask wallet.Select Network: Ensure your MetaMask is set to the correct Ethereum network where the smart contract is deployed (e.g., Sepolia Test Network or Ethereum Mainnet).Send Transaction:Enter the recipient's Ethereum address.Enter the amount of ETH to send.(Optional) Add a keyword and a message.Click the "Send Now" button.Confirm the transaction in your MetaMask wallet.View Transactions: The list below the transaction form will update with the latest transactions on the blockchain.ContributingContributions are welcome!
